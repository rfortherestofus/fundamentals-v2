```{r}
penguin_bill_length_by_island_and_sex <- penguins |> 
  drop_na(sex) |> 
  group_by(island, sex) |> 
  summarize(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = penguin_bill_length_by_island_and_sex,
       mapping = aes(x = island,
                     y = mean_bill_length,
                     fill = sex)) +
  geom_col()
