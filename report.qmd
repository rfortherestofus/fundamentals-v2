## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave **together** content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

This is a new paragraph

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

penguins <- read_csv("penguins.csv")

ggplot(data = penguins,
       mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| output: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
